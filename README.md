📈 Key Insights
New Delhi hosts the largest number of restaurants, but the highest-rated ones are in cities like Inner City (4.9) and Beechworth (4.6).

Most restaurants have an average rating of 2.9, indicating low differentiation in customer satisfaction.

Low-cost restaurants (<$50) dominate the dataset, and higher cost does not guarantee better ratings.

Only 12.12% of restaurants offer table booking, and 8.63% support online delivery—yet both are associated with slightly higher ratings.

⚠️ Challenges Faced
Missing Data: Incomplete location details and null values.

Inconsistent Formats: Especially in address and date fields.

Rating Skew: Ratings are heavily clustered around 2.9.

Tool Overlap: Balancing insights across different BI tools without redundancy.

✅ Recommendations
Improve data collection quality (especially coordinates and addresses).

Promote online delivery and table booking, especially for premium restaurants.

Study high-performing cities/restaurants to replicate success strategies.

Expand to cities with high average ratings (e.g., Beechworth, Makati City).

Consider timing for new openings — Q3 (July–Sept) sees the most new restaurants.

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analytics can uncover hidden trends and opportunities in the food industry. The analysis provides actionable recommendations for Zomato and similar platforms to improve service offerings and expand strategically.
